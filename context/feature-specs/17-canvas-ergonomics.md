Add a floating control bar for zoom and undo/redo, then wire the same actions to keyboard shortcuts.

## Implementation

1. Add a pill-shaped control bar at the bottom-left of canvas.
    
    It should sit above the shape panel and include two groups:
    - zoom controls: zoom out, fit view, zoom in 
    - history controls: undo, redo

    Separate the two groups with a thin divider.

2. Wire the zoom controls to the React Flow instance.
    - zoom in 
    - zoom out 
    - fit view 
    - use a short animation so the movement feels smooth

3. Wire undo and redo the Liveblocks history. 
    - use the existing Liveblocks undo/redo hooks
    - disable undo when there is nothing to undo
    - disable redo when there is nothing to redo
    - keep disabled buttons visually dimmed

4. Create a `useKeyboardShortcuts` hook in `hooks/`.

    The hook should:
    - receive the React Flow instance
    - receive undo and redo handlers
    - listen for keyboard shortcuts on `window`
    - ignore shortcuts while typing in inputs, textareas, or editable text fields

5. Support these shortcuts:
    - `+` or `=` to zoom in 
    - `-` to zoom out 
    - `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` to undo
    - `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` to redo
    - `Cmd/Ctrl + Y` to redo

## Scope Limits

- don't change the shape panel
- don't change the node or edge rendering
- don't add extra canvas controls
- don't change the exisiting collaborative state setup
- keep this focused on resize and label editing only

## Check when done
- Select the nodes show resizes handled.
- Resizing updates node dimensions through the existing node stae Flow
- Double clicking a node opens inline lable editing.
- Label editing updates node labels through existing sync flow.
- Editing closes on blur or Escape.
- Text interactions do not trigger canvas drag on pan.
- `npm run build` passed without type errors.
