The database schema is ready. Build the backend project API routes only.

## Routes

Create REST endpoints for: 

- `GET /api/projects`
- `POST /api/projects`
- `PATCH /api/projects`
- `DELETE /api/projects`

## Rules 

Use the authenticated Clerk user ID as `ownerId`.

When creating:

- default missing project name to `Untitled Project`
- use the schema's existing ID strategy, do not add sequential IDs

Security:

- unauthenticated requests return `401`
- only the project owner can rename or DELETE
- non-owner mutations return `403`

Keep this backend-only. Do not wire the UI yet.


## Check When Done

- routes exist for list/create/rename/DELETE
- owner checks are enforced for rename/DELETE
- `401` and `403` response are handled correctly
- `npm run build` passes
